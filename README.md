# Python generator
This Python generator code is designed to generate secure, randomized strings based on specific patterns using regular expressions.

## Overview
It makes use of a while loop to repeatedly generate these strings until certain conditions are met. The code combines various Python libraries to enhance functionality, ensure randomness, and handle complex string manipulations.
