# Python generator
This Python generator code is designed to generate secure, randomized strings based on specific patterns using regular expressions.

## Overview
It makes use of a while loop to repeatedly generate these strings until certain conditions are met. The code combines various Python libraries to enhance functionality, ensure randomness, and handle complex string manipulations.

## Features
- Secure Random String Generator
   - Uses the **secrets** module to generate strong, random numbers.
- Regular Expression Matching 
   - The **re** module is employed to verify if the generated string matches a specific pattern
- Customize patterns
   - Allows for flexible string pattern generation based on defined conditions.
- Infinite looping
   - The **while** loop runs continously until the generated string meets the conditions.
- Effeciency
   -  The **secrets** module ensures randomness.
