# Python generator
This Python generator code is designed to generate secure, randomized strings based on specific patterns using regular expressions.

## Overview
The code utilizes a **while** loop to continuously generate random strings until they meet specific conditions. By leveraging various Python libraries, it enhances functionality, ensures randomness, and handles complex string manipulations.

## Features
### 1. Secure Random String Generator
   - Uses the **secrets** module to generate strong, random numbers.
### 2. Regular Expression Matching 
   - The **re** module is employed to verify if the generated string matches a specific pattern
### 3. Customize patterns
   - Allows for flexible string pattern generation based on defined conditions.
### 4. Infinite looping
   - The **while** loop runs continously until the generated string meets the conditions.
### 5. Effeciency
   -  The **secrets** module ensures randomness.
## Summary
This Python generator script provides a secure and efficient way to generate randomized strings that meet specific pattern requirements. With the help of the `secrets`, `re`, and `string` modules, the script ensures cryptographically strong randomness, flexible pattern matching, and efficient generation in a loop until the desired condition is met.
